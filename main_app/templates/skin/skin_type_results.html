<h2>Your skin type is {{ skin_type }}.</h2>
{% if skin_type == 'Normal' %}
<h2>Normal Skin</h2>
<p>
  Your skin is well-balanced, with neither excessive oil nor dry patches. It
  feels smooth and has a regular texture with minimal imperfections.
</p>
<h3>Care Tips:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Maintain your skin’s health with a balanced skincare routine that includes
    gentle cleansing, regular moisturizing, and sun protection.
  </li>
  <li>Occasional light exfoliation can help maintain its glow.</li>
</ul>

{% elif skin_type == 'Dry' %}
<h2>Dry Skin</h2>
<p>
  Your skin often feels tight and may exhibit flakiness or scaling. It can
  appear dull due to a lack of moisture and might be more prone to sensitivity.
</p>
<h3>Care Tips:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Focus on hydration by using rich moisturizers and creams that contain
    hyaluronic acid and ceramides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid hot showers and harsh cleansers that can strip your skin of its
    natural oils.
  </li>
</ul>

{% elif skin_type == 'Oily' %}
<h2>Oily Skin</h2>
<p>
  Your skin tends to produce excess oil, leading to a shiny complexion and
  making it prone to breakouts and enlarged pores.
</p>
<h3>Care Tips:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use oil-free and non-comedogenic products to avoid clogging pores.</li>
  <li>
    Incorporate a regular cleansing routine, use a gentle exfoliant to manage
    oil levels, and don’t skip moisturizer—opt for a lightweight, water-based
    formula.
  </li>
</ul>

{% elif skin_type == 'Combination' %}
<h2>Combination Skin</h2>
<p>
  Combination skin features a mix of oily and dry zones, typically with oiliness
  in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) and dryness on the cheeks.
</p>
<h3>Care Tips:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Treat different areas with targeted products—lighter, oil-control products
    for the T-zone and richer moisturizers for dry areas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Balancing the skin’s needs can be key to managing combination skin
    effectively.
  </li>
</ul>

{% elif skin_type == 'Sensitive' %}
<h2>Sensitive Skin</h2>
<p>
  Your skin is reactive and can be easily irritated by environmental factors,
  products, or stress, often resulting in redness, itching, or rashes.
</p>
<h3>Care Tips:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Opt for hypoallergenic and fragrance-free products to minimize potential
    irritations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be gentle with your skin, avoiding aggressive exfoliants and opting for
    soothing ingredients like aloe vera and chamomile.
  </li>
</ul>
